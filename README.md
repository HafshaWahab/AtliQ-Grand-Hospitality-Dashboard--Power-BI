# Data Overview

The dataset for AtliQ Grands Hotels comprises 134,590 records, organized into five key tables, including two fact tables (fact_bookings, fact_aggregated) and three dimension tables (dim_date, dim_hotels, dim_rooms). The data covers operations across 25 properties located in four major cities: Hyderabad, Bangalore, Mumbai, and Delhi. The information spans various aspects of hotel operations, providing insights into booking trends, room occupancy, revenue generation, and customer preferences.

**Provide data-driven recommendations** aimed at enhancing AtliQ Grands' market position and improving financial outcomes.

# Methodology

The analysis follows a structured approach:

**2. Data Cleaning:** Ensuring the data is accurate, consistent, and free of errors, missing values, or duplicates.

**3. Data Modeling:** Structuring the data into a star schema model to optimize analysis and reporting.

**4. Data Analysis:** Performing detailed analysis on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Average Daily Rate (ADR), Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR), Occupancy Rate, and Cancellation Rate.

**Revenue and Occupancy Trends:** AtliQ Grands generated $1.71 billion in revenue with a 57.87% occupancy rate, indicating a significant portion of rooms remain unoccupied.

**Market Performance:** The highest revenue-generating cities are Mumbai ($668.64M), Bangalore ($420.4M), and Hyderabad ($325.2M), with Delhi lagging at $294.5M.

**Customer Preferences:** Elite, Standard, and Premium rooms are the most preferred by customers, with 40.9% of bookings being made through external platforms, which might be affecting direct sales and revenue predictability.

**Competitive Pressure:** Increased competition and possibly inefficient pricing strategies have led to a reduction in market share.

# Recommendations

**1. Dynamic Pricing:** Implement a dynamic pricing strategy that adjusts room rates based on real-time demand, competition, and market conditions to maximize revenue.

**2. Service Evaluation:** Continuously evaluate and enhance the services offered to ensure they meet or exceed customer expectations, thereby improving satisfaction and retention.

**3. Diversification of Booking Platforms:** Increase the focus on direct bookings through the companyâ€™s website and mobile app to reduce dependency on third-party platforms and improve profitability.

**4. Customer and Employee Satisfaction:** Regularly assess and improve both customer and employee satisfaction to enhance service quality and operational efficiency.

These recommendations, if implemented effectively, can help AtliQ Grands regain its market position and improve its financial performance in the face of rising competition.
